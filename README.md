# Youtube_Clone
This is my first Web Dev Project which is completely based off of the tasks done in the html, css tutorial video by SuperSimpleDev. (For ACM Inductions)
The html files and the folders including the different components of the website have been added. 
'styles' has the required css files, 'icons' has the svg files (icons like home, notifications,etc), "thumbnails' has the static webp format photos of the videos I
have included in my website. 'channel-pictures' has the required jpeg files of the channels whose videos I've included.
